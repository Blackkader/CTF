**Welcome fellow hackers!  I hope you will enjoy this CTF. ( YOU WILL TRUST ME !!)**

 SO , for mobile security , the tools you're gonna need are those :
 * [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
* [jadx-gui](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)
* [ida](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml)

I won't tell what each one does , it's up to you to figure it out.


_Notes :_
* **You can find similar tools to those mentioned above , you don't have to use them.**

* **PLEASEEEE** open a ticket if you're stuck in literally anything , i'll be happy to help you out (whenever i am not asleep).
